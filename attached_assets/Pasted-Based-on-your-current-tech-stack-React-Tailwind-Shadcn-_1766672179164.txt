Based on your current tech stack (React, Tailwind, Shadcn UI) and the "Civic Resolve" theme, here are specific UI Design suggestions you can prototype in Canva and then build.

These designs focus on making the app look modern, trustworthy, and engaging.

1. The "Before & After" Resolution Card
Instead of just showing "Resolved," visually prove the work is done. This is excellent for the Complaint History or a public "Impact Feed."

Visual Concept: A card split in half (or with a slider).

Left Side: Photo of the issue (e.g., Pothole) with a red "Reported" tag.

Right Side: Photo of the fix (e.g., Repaired Road) with a green "Resolved" tag.

Canva Design Tip: Use a "Compare" layout. Add a timestamp on both sides (e.g., "Oct 10" vs "Oct 12") to show speed.

Code Implementation: Use aspect-ratio in Tailwind to keep images uniform.

2. The "Visual" Status Timeline
Your TrackGrievance page likely lists status updates. Make it a visual journey.

Visual Concept: A horizontal or vertical "Stepper."

Step 1 (Submitted): Blue Check.

Step 2 (In Progress): An animated pulsing orange circle (indicates activity).

Step 3 (Resolved): A solid Green trophy or checkmark.

Canva Design Tip: Search for "Infographic Timeline" elements. Use icons like Clipboard -> Worker -> Checkmark.

3. Glassmorphism Map Overlay
For the map feature we discussed, don't just put a map on a white background.

Visual Concept: floating "Control Panel" over the map.

The Map takes up the full screen background.

The "Filter" options (Water, Roads, Garbage) are in a frosted glass box floating on the top-left.

Why: It looks premium (like Apple Maps or high-end dashboards).

Tailwind Class: bg-white/30 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20 shadow-lg rounded-xl.

4. Gamification "Citizen Badges"
To make the "Leaderboard" or "Profile" interesting, design 3D-style badges.

Visual Concept:

"Guardian of Green": For reporting garbage/tree issues.

"Road Warrior": For reporting potholes.

"Civic Hero": For 10+ verified reports.

Canva Design Tip: Search for "3D Icon Badges" or "Achievement Badges."

UI Placement: Display these prominently on the CitizenDashboard next to the user's name.

5. Mobile "Floating Action Button" (FAB)
Since citizens will use this on phones while walking outside:

Visual Concept: A large, circular button fixed at the bottom-center of the screen with a generic "Plus" (+) icon or a Camera icon.

Action: Pressing it immediately opens the "Submit Grievance" camera view.

Canva Design Tip: Design a button with a subtle "Glow" or "Shadow" effect to make it look clickable.

Tailwind Class: fixed bottom-6 right-6 h-14 w-14 rounded-full shadow-2xl bg-primary hover:scale-105 transition-transform.

Summary of What to Design in Canva First:
Badge Icons: (Gold/Silver/Bronze styles).

Map Pin Icons: Custom pins for different categories (Drop of water for 'Water Supply', Traffic Cone for 'Roads').

Hero Banner: A clean illustration of a futuristic/clean city for your Index.tsx landing page.
